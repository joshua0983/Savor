# Vision Document

# Introduction


Our vision for this app is an interface that allows users to leave reviews of restaurants they eat at Unlike other reviewing apps, however, this app also lets them create friend lists and see restaurant reviews that their friends are leaving. This social aspect is the unique angle that this app emphasizes, and what sets it apart from similar apps. We think that users will enjoy connecting with their friends on this app, because seeing restaurant reviews are more meaningful when they come from people you already know and trust. 

# Business Case
 
1. Our application lets you rate specific restaurants based on your preference.
2. You and your friends can log in their review on the app.
3. You can interact with your friends and see what meals and restaurants are the best.
